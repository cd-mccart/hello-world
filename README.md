# hello-world
This is my horrific attempt to create a new repository. 

- I am pleased to report that nothing has gone terribly wrong yet.

- I am also pleased to report that there's plenty of time left in the day for things to go terribly wrong.

#### How can I be creative and do creative things?
Ok, thanks for sticking with me up to this point.  I am going to slowly add more material to this
